# spring-boot-template
This is a template for a Spring Boot application. This project aims to provide an out of the box Spring Boot application with a backend and frontend. The frontend is a bootstrap template.

### Setup
As this is a maven project the first thing you will want to do is use maven to handle all of the application's dependencies. To do this
you will need to install [maven] (https://maven.apache.org/). Once this is done simply navigate to where you cloned the project
and execute the command `mvn clean install`. You should now be able to go into your text editor and click run. To see if the application
is running successful go to your browser and search for `localhost:8080`. You should see a bootstrap template page.

### Contributions
Please feel free to submit pull requests to the master branch from your fork. It would be great if this template is as complete
and general as possible so that it benefits many starting new Spring boot applications or for those who are learning Spring.
